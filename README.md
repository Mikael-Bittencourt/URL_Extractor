# URL_Extractor

## Description:
URL_Extractor is a small Python project that takes a URL string and finds its parameters and values, the project was done following the "String em Python" course from Alura. The program does not take in user input, but rather just has the URL string assigned, as the focus of the project was learning about string manipulation in Python.

## What I learned:
- String manipulation in Python
- Application of object orientation
- Understanding the string class more in-depth

## Technologies Utilized:
- Programing Language: Python
- IDE: PyCharm
